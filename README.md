# object_detection-and-object_tracking
First the object is detected and then it is tracked with the help of open computer vision libraries
from "tracker.py" you can change the ".mp4" filename from "highway1" to any file of your choice
you can change the targeted mask to a bigger frame by adjusting the x,y,h,w parameters
