# object_detection-and-object_tracking
First the object is detected and then it is tracked with the help of open computer vision libraries.
From "main.py" you can change the ".mp4" filename from "highway1" to any file of your choice.
You can change the targeted frame "roi" to a bigger frame by adjusting the x,y,h,w parameters from "main.py" .
To stop the detection and tracking you can press "esc" key.

NOTE: This only works when the camera is stationary
